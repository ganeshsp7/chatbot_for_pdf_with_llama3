known
as
a
controlled-phase
gate,
is
a
two-qubit
quantum
gate
that
introduces
a
phase
shift
depending
on
the
state
of
the
control
qubit.
The
action
of
the
Cz
gate
is
to
apply
a
phase
shift
of
−1
to
the
|11
⟩
state
while
leaving
the
other
basis
states
unchanged.
The
mathematical
operation
of
the
Cz
gate
can
be
described
as:
Cz
∣
00
⟩
=
∣
00
⟩
Cz
∣
01

=
∣

Cz
∣
10
⟩
=
∣
10
⟩
Cz
∣
11
⟩
=−
∣
11
⟩
The
Cz
gate
is
a
key
component
in
quantum
circuits
and
is
used
in
various
quantum
algorithms
and
quantum
error
correction
protocols.
It
is
particularly
important
in
constructing
controlled
gates
and
implementing
certain
quantum
algorithms
like
quantum
phase
estimation
and
quantum
teleportation.NOT

The
NOT
gate,
also
known
as
the
Pauli
X
gate,
flips
the
∣
0

state
to
∣
1
⟩
,
and
vice
versa.
The
NOT
gate
is
equivalent
to
RX
for
the
angle
π
or
‘HZH’.The
quantum
NOT
gate
is
a
fundamental
quantum
gate
that
plays
a
crucial
role
in
quantum
computing.
It
is
the
analog
of
the
classical
NOT
gate
and
can
be
represented
in
a
quantum
circuit
as
a
circle
with
a
cross
in
it.
The
NOT
gate
is
reversible,
meaning
that
