Hadamard

he
H,
or
Hadamard,
gate
that
rotates
the
states
is
useful
for
making
superpositions.
If
you
have
a
universal
gate
set
on
a
classical
computer
and
add
the
Hadamard
gate,
it
becomes
a
universal
gate
set
on
a
quantum
computer.

Π.
It

gate:
Z-Gate
Matrix
The
Pauli
Z
gate
acts
as
identity
on
the
∣
0
⟩
state
and
multiplies
the
sign
of
the
∣
1
⟩
state
by
-1.
It
therefore
flips
the
∣
+
⟩
and
∣
−
⟩
states.
In
the
+/-
basis,
it
plays
the
same
role
as
the
NOT
gate
in
the
∣
0
⟩
/
∣

⟩
basis.
