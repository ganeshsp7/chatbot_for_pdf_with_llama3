This
section
is
a
reference
that
defines
the
various
classical
and
quantum
operations
you
can
use
to
manipulate
qubits
in
the
quantum
circuit
using
the
gates.
Quantum
operations
include
quantum
gates,
such
as
the
Hadamard
gate,
and
operations
that
are
not
quantum
gates,
such
as
the
measurement
operation,
etc.
Each
entry
below
provides
details,
gate
matrix
reference,
and
the
OpenQASM
reference
for
each
gate
operation.

In
quantum
computing
and
specifically
the
quantum
circuit
model
of
computation,
a
quantum
logic
gate
(or
simply
quantum
gate)
is
a
basic
quantum
circuit
operating
on
a
small
number
of
qubits
that
are
the
building
blocks
of
quantum
circuits.
Quantum
gates
operate
on
quantum
bits
(qubits).
This
means
that
quantum
gates
can
leverage
two
key
aspects
of
quantum
mechanics
that
are
entirely
out
of
reach
for
classical
gates:
superposition
and
entanglement.
Drag
and
drop
these
gates
and
other
operations
onto

Different
types
of
gates
are
grouped
by
color.
For
example,
classical
gates
are
dark
blue,
phase
gates
are
light
blue,
and
non-unitary
operations
are
grey.
