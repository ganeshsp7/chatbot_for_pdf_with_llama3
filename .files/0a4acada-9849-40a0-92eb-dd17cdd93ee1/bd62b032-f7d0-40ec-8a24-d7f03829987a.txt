QACC
Quantum
Composer
has
a
customizable
set
of
tools
that
allow
you
to
build,
visualize,
and
run
quantum
circuits
and
algorithms
on
quantum
systems
or
simulators.
What
can
the
QACC
composer
do?
●
Visualize
Qubit
states
Learn
how
changes
to
your
circuit
affect
qubit
states
with
probability
Distribution,
measurement
probabilities,
and
state
vector
simulations.
●
Quantum
Hardware
Run
your
circuits
on
real
quantum
hardware
to
understand
the
effects
of
device
noise
with
QPU.
●
Automatically
generate
code
Instead
of
manually
writing
code,
use
QACC
Composer
to
automatically
generate
OpenQASM
or
Python
code
in
Qiskit
that
mimics
your
circuit.
