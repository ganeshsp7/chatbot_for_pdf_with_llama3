can
be
applied
to
any
qubit
by
calling
the
p()
method
on
the
Quantum
Circuit.
The
p()
method
is
parameterized,
so
the
phase
(in
radians)
that
needs
to
be
applied
to
the
qubit
must
be
passed
to
it.

Matrix
In
quantum
computing,
the
T
gate
is
a
single-qubit
gate
that
creates
phase
shifts.
It
rotates
the
state
of
a
qubit
by
an
angle
of
π/4
radians.
Also
known
as
the
Tdg
or
T-dagger
gate.
The
T
gate
is
also
known
as
the
π/4
gate.
It
is
related
to
the
S
gate
by
the
relationship
S
=
T
2.

The
Rz-gate
or
the
R
ϕ-
gate
would
be
the
first
parametrized
gate
that
will
be
introduced.
By
“parametrized”
we
mean
that
it
accepts
a
parameter
and
performs
an
operation
based
on
this
parameter .
The
parameter
accepted
here
is
ϕ
and
the
operation
performed
is
rotation
around
the
z-axis
by
ϕ
radians.
