T
gate
is
a
single-qubit
gate
that
creates
phase
shifts.
It’s
also
known
as
the
π/4
gate.
The
T
gate
rotates
the
state
of
a
qubit
by
an
angle
of
π/4
radians.
It
applies
a
phase
shift
to
the
qubit’s
state,
specifically
to
the
|1>
state,
while
leaving
the
|0>
state
unchanged.
The
T
gate
is
also
known
as
the
π/8
gate
because
of
how
the
RZ(
π/4)
matrix
looks
like.
It’s
also
known
as
the
fourth
root
of
the
Pauli
Z
gate
because
applying
the
T
gate
four
times
is
equivalent
to
applying
the
Pauli
Z
gate.

The
S
gate
applies
a
phase
of
i
to
the
∣
1
⟩
state.
It
is
equivalent
to
RZ
for
the
angle
π/2.
Also
S=P(
π/2).
Referring
to
quantum
mechanics,
the
S
gate
is
a
90-degree
rotation
around
the
z-axis.
It
is
also
known
as
the
phase
gate
or
the
Z90
gate.
The
S
gate
is
related
to
the
T
gate
by
the
relationship
S
=
